# IntegratedAdditions

Integrated Additions is an addon mod for Integrated Dynamics, which can speed up the construction of your own network.

Note: I found that there was an addon developers document in integrated dynamics when mod was about to be released, which I didn't know before production.Because it's the first time to make minecraft mod and it only took one week to make it in my spare time, my English is very poor, so the translation of this article and mod will be very bad, so if there is something wrong with it, please correct me.

 

Currently, it has the following functions (please let me know if you have better suggestions)
